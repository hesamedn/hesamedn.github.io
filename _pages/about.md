* I’m an M.Sc. student of Physics from the [Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences(IASBS), Zanjan, Iran](https://iasbs.ac.ir/?lang=en).  I'm working on the Numerical Simulation of the KPZ equation. I focus on the Finite Element Method based on the Moving Mesh using to discretize the 1+1 Dimensional KPZ model in the Strong Coupling Limit. My numerical simulations are performed with Python and c++.

* I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics from the [University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran,](https://uma.ac.ir/index.php?slc_lang=en) where I was advised by Dr. [Zahra Ebadi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zahra-Ebadi).
