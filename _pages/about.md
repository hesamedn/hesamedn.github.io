* I’m an M.Sc. student of Physics from the [Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences(IASBS), Zanjan, Iran](https://iasbs.ac.ir/?lang=en).  I'm working on the Numerical Simulation of the KPZ equation. I focus on the Finite Element Method based on the Moving Mesh using to discretize the 1+1 Dimensional KPZ model in the Strong Coupling Limit. My numerical simulations are performed with Python and c++. [Dr. Mohammad D. Niry](https://iasbs.ac.ir/~m.d.niry/)  and [Dr. Bahman Farnudi](https://iasbs.ac.ir/~farnudi/stsn_eng.htm) are my Supervisor.

* In my spare time, I sometimes study other branches of Science like sociology, I also like to connect with other disciplines and multidisciplinary teams.

* I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Physics from the [University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran,](https://uma.ac.ir/index.php?slc_lang=en) where I was advised by [Dr. Zahra Ebadi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zahra-Ebadi).

* My research interests lie in the general area of Complex Systems, Network Science and Data Science, particularly in Nonequilibrium Roughening in Surface Growth, and Spreading Phenomena (Epidemic models) in Network.


Our Group
=========

**Dr. Mohammad D. Niry** and **Dr. Bahman Farnudi** are the heads of our research group at the Faculty of Physics of the [Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences(IASBS), Zanjan, Iran](https://iasbs.ac.ir/?lang=en). Our favorite research topics are:
* Neuroscience
* Sandpile Model
* Spreading Phenomena
* Synchronization, Kuramoto model
* Stochastic nature of seismic activity
* Surface growth model (EW, KPZ, and RSOS)
* Localization of wave in disordered media
* Random Walk and Fractional Brownian motion
* The Intermittency issue in Burgulence and Turbulence.
